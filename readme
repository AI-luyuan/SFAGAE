# SFGAE

## Introduction
SFGAE is a self-feature-based graph autoencoder model for miRNA-disease associations prediction. The key novelty of SFGAE is to construct miRNA-self embeddings and disease-self embeddings, and let them be independent of graph interactions between two types of nodes.


## Environment Requirement
The code has been tested running under Python 3.7.5. The required packages are as follows:
- dgl == 0.4.3
- mxnet == 1.6.0.post0
- numpy == 1.20.3
- pandas == 1.3.4
- pytorch == 1.8.0
- scikit-learn == 1.0.1


## Example to Run the Codes

```python mainauto.py```

## Dataset
We provide two processed datasets based on HMDD v2.0 and HMDD v3.2.  

The HMDD v2.0 dataset contains 495 miRNAs and 383 diseases, with 5430 associations between them.
The HMDD v3.2 dataset contains 11930 associations between the miRNA and disease nodes in HMDD v2.0 dataset.
The files corresponding to the two types of associations are: all_mirna_disease_pairs.csv and all_mirna_disease_pairs_3.csv.

## Data description

all_mirna_disease_pairs.csv: miRNA-disease associations of HMDD v2.0 
all_mirna_disease_pairs_3.csv: miRNA-disease associations of HMDD v3.2 
D_GSM.txt: Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity
D_SSM1.txt: Disease semantic similarity
D_SSM2.txt:Disease semantic similarity
M_FSM.txt: miRNA functional similarity
M_GSM.txt: Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity


## Weights of the trained SFGAE
We share the weights of the trained SFGAE. The weights are the result of 5-fold cross validation.


## Survival analysis
We performed a survival analysis of the top 40 miRNAs predicted by SFGAE for kidney neoplasms. 
We provide all the analysis results in the folder "Survival_analysis".
